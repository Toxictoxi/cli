Last update: May-2025 (debian-12.10.0)

0- [Disable Secure Boot]
   $ sudo mokutil --disable-validation
1- [Install Debian]
   - Select "Expert Install"
   - Install minimal debian 12 to start from command-line
   - Do not select "allow login as root" to enable the "sudo" command
   - Do not download or install extras, we're going to update the kernel
   $ sudo apt edit-sources    # comment out the "cdrom" line if needed
2- [Setup Networking]
   $ ip link
   $ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   $ sudo service networking restart
   net-tether.sh              # quick setup USB tethering (optional)
3- [Git Clone]
   $ sudo apt install git
   $ git clone https://github.com/nimadez/cli
4- [Select Branch]
   apt-sources.sh             # generate debian sources.list
   $ update && full-upgrade && reboot
5- [Software Installation]
   apt-install-headers.sh     # install kernel headers
   apt-install-nvidia.sh      # install nvidia driver, reboot is required (all non-free)
   apt-install-gnome.sh       # minimal gnome-core only, no firefox and games (all free)
   apt-install-free.sh        # install common free software
   gnome-debloat.sh           # be careful, it will remove the gnome-software
6- [Finish Installation]
   swap-make.sh               # make a swap file if you don't have a swap partition
   purge-cache.sh             # purge ~/.cache if you don't keep permanent files there

* Bookworm "stable-proposed" branch without "backports" is recommended.
* Remember to reinstall kernel headers after every kernel update. (testing branch)
* Firefox has been removed from the gnome-core, but is highly recommended.
```
How to run these scripts system wide?
```
sh install.sh
* This will symlink scripts to "/usr/local/bin" and remove extensions.
```
